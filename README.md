# Aussie Victor MT5

Aussie Victor MT5 is a grid-based trading system developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This expert advisor aims to automate trading decisions based on a combination of grid trading, cost averaging, machine learning, and smart stop loss techniques.

## Grid-based Trading Parameters

The grid-based trading parameters allow you to customize the grid size and spacing between grid levels. The `GridSize` parameter represents the size of each grid level in pips, while the `GridSpacing` parameter determines the distance between each grid level.

## Cost Averaging Parameters

The cost averaging parameters enable you to define the number of cost averaging levels and the increment size for each level. The `NumLevels` parameter specifies the number of levels to be used for cost averaging, while the `IncrementSize` parameter determines the increment size in pips for each level.

## Machine Learning Integration Parameters

The machine learning integration parameters provide the option to enable machine learning and set the parameters for pattern identification. By enabling the `MachineLearningEnabled` parameter, the expert advisor will perform a machine learning process to identify price patterns. The `PatternLength` parameter defines the length of the price patterns to be identified, and the `PatternThreshold` parameter sets the threshold for pattern identification.

## Trade Entry and Exit Parameters

The trade entry and exit parameters allow you to set the desired entry and exit levels for trades. The `EntryLevel` parameter represents the desired entry level, while the `ExitLevel` parameter defines the exit level.

## Smart Stop Loss Parameters

The smart stop loss parameters provide the option to enable a smart stop loss feature. By enabling the `StopLossEnabled` parameter, the expert advisor will monitor the drawdown and close all positions if the drawdown limit is reached. The `StopLossLimit` parameter determines the stop loss limit in percentage or monetary value, and the `StopLossCurrency` parameter specifies the currency unit for the stop loss limit.

## Expert Functions

### OnInit

The `OnInit` function is called during the expert initialization process. It is responsible for initializing necessary variables and indicators. In this function, you can perform any required setup and initialization tasks.

### OnDeinit

The `OnDeinit` function is called during the expert deinitialization process. It is responsible for performing any necessary cleanup tasks before the expert advisor is removed from the chart.

### OnTick

The `OnTick` function is called on each tick of the chart. It is the main function where the trading logic is implemented. The function performs the following tasks:

1. Checks if machine learning is enabled and performs the machine learning process to identify price patterns.
2. Checks if the price is at a grid level and determines whether to update positions based on cost averaging or open new positions at the grid level.
3. Checks if the price hits the exit level and closes all positions at the exit level.
4. Checks if the smart stop loss is enabled and if the drawdown limit is reached, closes all positions to limit losses.

### IsAtGridLevel

The `IsAtGridLevel` function is responsible for implementing the logic to check if the price is at a grid level. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the price is at a grid level.

### PositionsExist

The `PositionsExist` function checks if there are open positions. It returns a boolean value indicating whether there are open positions.

### UpdatePositions

The `UpdatePositions` function updates positions based on the cost averaging technique. It implements the logic to adjust positions according to the cost averaging strategy.

### OpenPositions

The `OpenPositions` function opens new positions at the grid level. It implements the logic to open positions based on the grid trading strategy.

### IsAtExitLevel

The `IsAtExitLevel` function checks if the price hits the exit level. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the price hits the exit level.

### ClosePositions

The `ClosePositions` function closes all positions at the exit level. It implements the logic to close all positions when the price reaches the exit level.

### IsDrawdownLimitReached

The `IsDrawdownLimitReached` function checks if the drawdown limit is reached. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the drawdown limit is reached.
